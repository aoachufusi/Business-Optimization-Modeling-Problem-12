# Modeling Problem 12
An oil company has 6000 barrels of oil 1 (with quality level 10) and 11,000 barrels of oil 2 (with quality level 6) and cannot restock for this selling period. The company sells two products made from a combination of the two oils: Gasoline which must have an average quality level of at least 8, and heating oil, which must have an average quality level of at least 7. Each dollar spent advertising gasoline results in 3 barrels of demand and each dollar spent advertising heating oil results in 7 barrels of demand, and there is no demand without advertising.

### Write and solve an optimization model to answer the following question:
If gasoline is sold for $35 per barrel, and heating oil is sold for $30 per barrel, what should the oil company sell to maximize profit?
